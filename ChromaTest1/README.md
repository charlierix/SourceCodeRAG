This is meant to be an incredibly basic test of using chroma db, following [this](https://docs.trychroma.com/getting-started) guide

## prep
Pull up a command prompt of this folder (type cmd in the address bar of windows explorer)

Create a virtual environment with this command (makes an isolated environment so pip installs aren't machine level)
```console
python -m venv .venv
```

Then activate the virtual environment
```console
.venv\scripts\activate
```

Finally pip install the contents of requirements.txt
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once that's all set up, drag the folder onto vs code.  It will know to activate the virtual environment when you run the scripts

## load_rag.py
Reads the json files generated by RAGSnippetBuilder, stores the Text property of each snippet into chroma
